# The Spiral Language

Functional programming language compiling to F# and Cuda C with decent integration for both. Is extremely efficient and expressive and boasts having intensional polymorphism and first-class staging. Made for the sake of making a deep learning library which was too difficult to do in F# itself for its author.

Currently, work is in progress on it. More information will be released soon...
